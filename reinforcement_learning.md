# Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning - Learning Guide

## What You Should Have Learned

### Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

1. **What is Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Agent-Environment Interaction**: An agent learns by taking actions in an environment
   - **Reward-based Learning**: Agent receives rewards/penalties for actions
   - **Goal**: Learn a policy that maximizes total cumulative reward
   - **Trial and Error**: Learning through experimentation, not supervised examples

2. **Key RL Components**
   - **Agent**: The learner that makes decisions (your AI player)
   - **Environment**: The world the agent operates in (FrozenLake game)
   - **State**: Current situation of the agent (position on the lake)
   - **Action**: What the agent can do (move up, down, left, right)
   - **Reward**: Feedback from environment (+1 for reaching goal, 0 for safe moves)

3. **FrozenLake Environment**
   - **4x4 grid world**: 16 states representing positions on frozen lake
   - **Goal**: Navigate from start (S) to goal (G) without falling in holes (H)
   - **Actions**: 4 possible moves (up=0, down=1, left=2, right=3)
   - **Rewards**: +1 for reaching goal, 0 otherwise
   - **Termination**: Episode ends when reaching goal or falling in hole

### Q-Learning Algorithm

4. **What is Q-Learning**
   - **Model-free**: Doesn't need to know environment dynamics
   - **Off-policy**: Can learn optimal policy while following different policy
   - **Value-based**: Learns value of state-action pairs
   - **Q-function**: Q(state, action) = expected future reward

5. **Q-Table Structure**
   - **2D array**: Rows = states (16), columns = actions (4)
   - **Q-values**: Each cell contains expected reward for taking action in state
   - **Initialization**: Start with zeros (no knowledge)
   - **Learning**: Update values based on experience

6. **Q-Learning Update Rule**
   ```
   Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α * (r + γ * max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a))
   ```
   - **α (Learning Rate)**: How much to trust new information (0.81)
   - **γ (Gamma/Discount Factor)**: Importance of future rewards (0.96)
   - **r**: Immediate reward received
   - **max(Q(s',a'))**: Best possible future reward from next state

### Exploration vs Exploitation

7. **The Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**
   - **Exploration**: Try random actions to discover new possibilities
   - **Exploitation**: Choose actions that currently seem best
   - **Balance**: Need both to find optimal policy
   - **ε-greedy Strategy**: Explore with probability ε, exploit otherwise

8. **Epsilon-Greedy Implementation**
   - **Epsilon (ε)**: Probability of exploring (starts at 0.9)
   - **High ε**: More exploration, less focused learning
   - **Low ε**: More exploitation, using learned knowledge
   - **Decay**: Reduce ε over time (ε -= 0.001 per episode)

9. **Adaptive Strategy**
   - **Early episodes**: High exploration to learn about environment
   - **Later episodes**: More exploitation to use learned knowledge
   - **Tracking**: Count explore vs exploit actions to monitor behavior

### Implementation Details

10. **Training Parameters**
    - **Episodes**: 1500 complete games to learn from
    - **Max Steps**: 100 step limit to prevent infinite loops
    - **Learning Rate**: 0.81 (high trust in new information)
    - **Discount Factor**: 0.96 (value long-term rewards highly)

11. **Training Loop Structure**
    ```python
    for episode in episodes:
        reset environment
        for step in max_steps:
            choose action (ε-greedy)
            take action, observe reward and next state
            update Q-table using Q-learning formula
            if episode finished: break
    ```

12. **State Transitions**
    - **Current state**: Where agent is now
    - **Action selection**: ε-greedy policy
    - **Environment step**: Execute action, get feedback
    - **Q-value update**: Learn from experience
    - **State update**: Move to next state

### Learning Analysis

13. **Performance Metrics**
    - **Average Reward**: Sum of rewards / number of episodes
    - **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes reaching goal
    - **Explore/Exploit Ratio**: Balance of strategies used
    - **Learning Curve**: Reward improvement over time

14. **Training Progress Visualization**
    - **Rolling Average**: Average reward over 100-episode windows
    - **Learning Curve**: Shows improvement over training
    - **Convergence**: Stabilization of performance
    - **Smooth Progress**: Moving average reduces noise

15. **Q-Table Interpretation**
    - **High Q-values**: Good state-action pairs
    - **Low Q-values**: Poor or unexplored combinations
    - **Policy Extraction**: argmax(Q[state, :]) gives best action
    - **Value Propagation**: Good states spread value to neighbors

### Key RL Concepts

16. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**
    - **States**: All possible situations
    - **Actions**: Available choices in each state
    - **Transition Probabilities**: How actions change states
    - **Rewards**: Feedback for state-action pairs
    - **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions

17. **Value Functions**
    - **State Value V(s)**: Expected reward from state
    - **Action Value Q(s,a)**: Expected reward from state-action pair
    - **Optimal Policy**: Policy that maximizes expected reward
    - **Bellman Equation**: Recursive relationship for optimal values

18. **Learning Challenges**
    - **Credit Assignment**: Which actions led to reward?
    - **Delayed Rewards**: Reward comes after many steps
    - **Exploration**: Need to try suboptimal actions to learn
    - **Convergence**: How to know when learning is complete?

### Advanced Concepts

19. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - **Learning Rate**: Too high = unstable, too low = slow learning
    - **Discount Factor**: Higher = more long-term planning
    - **Epsilon Decay**: How fast to reduce exploration
    - **Episode Count**: More episodes = better learning (diminishing returns)

20. **Extensions and Improvements**
    - **Function Approximation**: Neural networks instead of tables
    - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Q-learning with deep learning
    - **Policy Gradient Methods**: Direct policy optimization
    - **Actor-Critic**: Combine value and policy learning
