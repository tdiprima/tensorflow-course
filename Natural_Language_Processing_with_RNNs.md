# Natural Language Processing with RNNs - Learning Guide

## What You Should Have Learned

### Natural Language Processing Fundamentals

1. **What is NLP**
   - **Definition**: Communication between natural (human) languages and computers
   - **Applications**: Spellcheck, autocomplete, translation, sentiment analysis
   - **Challenge**: Converting human language to numerical data for machine learning
   - **Sequential nature**: Order of words matters for meaning

2. **Sequence Data Characteristics**
   - **Time/step relevance**: Unlike images, text has meaningful order
   - **Context dependency**: Meaning changes based on word sequence
   - **Variable length**: Sentences and documents have different lengths
   - **Word relationships**: Words relate to previous and following words

### Text Encoding Methods

3. **Bag of Words**
   - **Concept**: Count word frequency, ignore order
   - **Limitation**: Loses word sequence information
   - **Example**: "amazing movie" vs "movie amazing" encoded identically
   - **Use case**: Simple text classification when order doesn't matter

4. **Integer Encoding (One-Hot)**
   - **Improvement**: Maintains word order in sequences
   - **Method**: Each word gets unique integer, preserving position
   - **Advantage**: Can distinguish between different word orders
   - **Limitation**: No semantic similarity (e.g., "happy" and "joyful" unrelated)

5. **Word Embeddings**
   - **Advanced method**: Dense vectors representing word meaning and context
   - **Learned representations**: Similar words have similar embeddings
   - **Embedding layer**: Neural network layer that learns word representations
   - **Pre-trained options**: Use embeddings trained on large text corpora

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

6. **Why RNNs for Text**
   - **Sequential processing**: Process one word at a time, like humans reading
   - **Memory mechanism**: Maintain information about previously seen words
   - **Context building**: Gradually build understanding of entire input
   - **Variable length handling**: Can process sequences of any length

7. **RNN Architecture**
   - **Hidden state**: Internal memory carrying information from previous steps
   - **Loop structure**: Output from time t-1 becomes input at time t
   - **Recurrent connections**: Same weights used at each time step
   - **Unrolling**: Visualizing RNN as feed-forward network across time

8. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
   - **Problem with simple RNNs**: Vanishing gradient, forgets long-term dependencies
   - **LSTM solution**: Specialized gates control information flow
   - **Long-term memory**: Can remember information from much earlier in sequence
   - **Better performance**: Handles longer sequences more effectively

### Sentiment Analysis Implementation

9. **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**
   - **Binary classification**: Positive vs negative movie reviews
   - **25,000 reviews**: Balanced dataset for training
   - **Pre-encoded data**: Words already converted to integers by frequency
   - **Preprocessing**: Pad sequences to uniform length (250 words)

10. **Model Architecture**
    ```python
    Embedding(VOCAB_SIZE, 32) → LSTM(32) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
    ```
    - **Embedding layer**: Converts word indices to dense vectors
    - **LSTM layer**: Processes sequence with memory
    - **Dense output**: Single neuron with sigmoid for binary classification

11. **Training Process**
    - **Binary crossentropy**: Loss function for binary classification
    - **RMSprop optimizer**: Good for RNNs, handles gradient issues
    - **Validation split**: 20% of training data for monitoring overfitting
    - **Sequence padding**: Ensure all inputs same length for batching

### Text Generation with Character-Level RNNs

12. **Character-Level Modeling**
    - **Character sequences**: Model learns patterns in character sequences
    - **Shakespeare dataset**: Classic text for demonstrating text generation
    - **Character encoding**: Map each character to unique integer
    - **Sequence creation**: Input/output pairs where output is input shifted by one

13. **Training Data Preparation**
    - **Sequence length**: 100 characters per training example
    - **Input/target pairs**: "hell" → "ello" pattern
    - **Batching**: Process multiple sequences simultaneously
    - **Shuffling**: Randomize order to improve training

14. **Text Generation Architecture**
    ```python
    Embedding → LSTM(return_sequences=True) → Dense(vocab_size)
    ```
    - **Stateful LSTM**: Maintains state between batches
    - **Return sequences**: Output at each time step for next character prediction
    - **Dense output**: Probability distribution over all possible characters

15. **Generation Process**
    - **Seed text**: Starting string to begin generation
    - **Iterative prediction**: Use output to predict next character
    - **Temperature control**: Adjust randomness vs predictability
    - **Autoregressive**: Feed previous output as next input

### Advanced Concepts

16. **Sequence-to-Sequence Learning**
    - **Variable length input/output**: Handle different length sequences
    - **Applications**: Translation, summarization, question answering
    - **Encoder-decoder**: Separate networks for input processing and output generation

17. **Attention Mechanisms**
    - **Problem**: Long sequences lose information in fixed-size hidden state
    - **Solution**: Attention allows model to focus on relevant parts of input
    - **Applications**: Machine translation, document summarization

18. **Modern Alternatives**
    - **Transformers**: Attention-based models replacing RNNs
    - **BERT/GPT**: Pre-trained language models
    - **Transfer learning**: Use pre-trained models for specific tasks

### Key NLP Concepts

19. **Preprocessing Techniques**
    - **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or characters
    - **Vocabulary building**: Creating word-to-index mappings
    - **Sequence padding**: Making variable lengths uniform
    - **Text normalization**: Lowercasing, removing punctuation

20. **Evaluation Metrics**
    - **Accuracy**: For classification tasks
    - **Perplexity**: For language modeling (how surprised model is by text)
    - **BLEU score**: For text generation quality
    - **Human evaluation**: Ultimate test for generated text quality

### What's Next

This foundation prepares you for:
- **Transformer models**: BERT, GPT, T5 for modern NLP
- **Named entity recognition**: Identifying people, places, organizations
- **Machine translation**: Converting between languages
- **Question answering systems**: Building chatbots and virtual assistants
- **Document classification**: Categorizing emails, articles, reviews
- **Text summarization**: Automatically creating summaries

Understanding RNNs and sequence modeling is crucial even in the transformer era, as these concepts underlie all sequential data processing in machine learning. The skills you learned about handling text data, building vocabularies, and working with sequences apply to all NLP tasks.
